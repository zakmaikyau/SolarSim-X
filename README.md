# SolarSim-X: A High-Throughput ML-Physics Framework

SolarSim-X is a machine learning-enhanced simulation tool designed for rapid photovoltaic (PV) characterization. By bridging the gap between **Random Forest Regression** and the **Single-Diode Model (SDM)**, it enables high-throughput material screening 100x faster than traditional iterative solvers.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Physics-Informed ML:** Trained on 10,000+ samples grounded in semiconductor physics.
* **Extreme Speed:** Capable of running 120+ simulations in under 0.05 seconds.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Streamlit for easy parameter extraction and I-V plotting.
* **Scientific Accuracy:** Accurately identifies optimal bandgaps and recombination parameters.
